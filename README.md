# To-Do List

##Description:
A simple to-do list app written in Swift. This app was built to learn the concepts of some of XCode's core features (e.g. ViewController, Navigation Controller, Delegates, etc).

##Demo:

##Bugs Fixed:
1. Allows selection of last item without out-of-bounds error
2. Selecting, then deselecting an item, will not automatically add it to completed list
3. Doesn't add a blank item if the text field is empty
